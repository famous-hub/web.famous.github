    the nation as of September 20, according to data The PUNCH obtained Monday from the National

        Capital

      The most pressing needs of victims, according to NEMA, are food, shelter, health care, water and 
      sanitation, and assistance with livelihood. Following the floods, NEMA discovered a 
      number of barriers impeding response activities. The biggest issue, which accounted for 68% of 
      the difficulties reported, was a lack of resources. Subsequently, 17% of flooded communities 
      were inaccessible, making it challenging for rescue crews and relief supplies to get to victims. 
      Operations were also slowed in some areas by security risks (6%), and aid delivery and humanitarian 
      access were made more difficult by community resistance (7%).

      Displaced Gombe households Since the beginning of the rainy season, hundreds of households 
      have been displaced by floods, according to the Gombe State Emergency Management Agency, 
      which also reported that several people have died.

    According to Haruna Abdullahi, the Executive Secretary of SEMA, Gombe, at least 986 
    households have been impacted thus far, and flood-related incidents have claimed 15 lives. 
    "The state of affairs is concerning. We have reported 15 fatalities since the start of this rainy 
    season, and nearly 1,000 households have been displaced in various communities, Abdullahi stated. 
    One of the most recent incidents, he explained, happened at Jurara in Kwami Local Government Area,
     where roughly 96 people were displaced and are now being housed by community members. "There are 
     approximately 102 people who were displaced at Jalingon Kamu in Kaltungo Local Government Area and 
     are currently living with their neighbors," he continued. According to Abdullahi, the situation in 
     Funakaye Local Government Area was made worse by a tragic canoe accident. "Only two people survived 
     after a canoe capsized in a village close to Bage, killing five others," he said. However, the head 
    of SEMA promised that in the Rabah Local Government Area, rainstorms on September 4 and 9 
    devastated 61 communities, displacing over 5,300 households and destroying roughly 2,200 homes.
     Humanitarian organizations and community leaders are urging immediate actions to save lives, aid 
     displaced families, and fund long-term flood and water transport safety measures, as flooding has 
     already affected over 5,000 households and killed at least two people in Sokoto alone in the last two
      weeks. Kano homes and farmlands The recent flood disaster that devastated several Kano State local
       government areas over the past two weeks destroyed a large number of homes.

      <p class="dull">"The rainy season is coming to an end, but the problem is that whenever it rains, it always 
      comes with strong windstorms, which causes a lot of havoc to many houses by uprooting the 
      roofing of the affected houses," stated Alhaji Isyaku Kubarachi, Executive Secretary of
       the Kano SEMA. "We're still working on it, so I can't tell you the precise number of people 
       impacted or houses destroyed, but we have a number of these houses and we even recorded 
       fatalities," he said. Kunarachi stated that they would send the comprehensive report to 
       the state government once they had completed compiling the list of 
      impacted individuals and homes. 
      
      Kaduna flood camp: According to The PUNCH, a two-day period of intense rains also caused chaos 
      in Zaria and parts of Kaduna city, forcing at least 970 people—including hundreds of children—to 
      flee their homes and destroying at least 270 others.

      Beginning on September 11 and lasting until the early hours of September 12, the 
      torrential rains caused devastation in several Zaria communities and the heavily populated 
      Kigo Road Extension in Kaduna North Local Government Area. These were the highest numbers of 
      displaced people in Kaduna over the previous two weeks. Following what officials said was a 
      major improvement in the flood situation that had forced dozens of families to relocate in recent
       weeks, the Kaduna State Government announced the temporary closure of the Bashama flood 
       camp in Tudun Wada, Kaduna South Local Government Area. The camp housed 42 households 
       with 239 residents, including children, pregnant women, and people with disabilities, who were
        displaced from their homes when floodwaters flooded areas of the community, according to 
        the Kaduna State Emergency Management Agency.</p> 

<p class="dull">"The cooperation among all the stakeholders ensured that the entire operation 
was conducted seamlessly without any secondary incidents," stated Dr. Usman Mazadu, 
the secretary of KADSEMA, who was speaking during the exercise on behalf of Mubarak Zakari,
 the acting director of disaster and relief management. We were able to meet the displaced 
 families' immediate needs because of the efficient coordination from evacuation to shelter 
 management. Additionally, Governor Uba Sani reassured citizens of his administration's dedication
  to long-term flood mitigation and disaster preparedness. The governor said in a statement, 
  "We will keep collaborating with partners to strengthen Kaduna State's resilience and make sure 
  our communities are better protected against environmental hazards.". After spending weeks at the 
  camp, a few residents expressed gratitude for the support they received when they got home.

  returning home from weeks at the camp, some residents expressed their appreciation for the help 
  they had received.

  Aisha Abdullahi, a mother of four from Katagum Road, stated, "The government gave us food and 
  shelter while we recovered, even though we lost our belongings to the flood.". Post-flood assessments,
   according to officials, will continue to ascertain the complete extent of damage and direct subsequent 
   interventions. However, Zamfara state did not experience the flooding that was predicted to occur in
    many parts of the country,
  particularly in the North. </p>

  <p class="dull">Residents of Nasarawa move The Nasarawa State Emergency Management Agency has stepped up 
  its flood awareness campaign throughout the state's 13 LGAs, advising locals to move to higher 
  ground if they live near flood-prone areas. The Director of Planning, Research and Statistics at 
  NASEMA, Danladi Obagu, told our correspondent in Lafia, the state capital, that most people in
   flood-prone areas of Doma, Nasarawa, Toto, Awe, Lafia, and Obi LGAs had moved to safer locations 
   as a result of the agency's efforts. He added that in the event of unanticipated, severe flooding, 
   the organization had offered locations for the temporary relocation of displaced people throughout the 
   state. "I can guarantee you that we are working to make sure we can address the state's flooding problems. However, we urge people who live close to flood-prone areas to move to safer locations in order to safeguard their lives and property," he said.

  igawa SEMA, meanwhile, claimed to be adequately equipped to reduce flooding in the state. Hannafi 
  Yakubu, the secretary of the Jigawa State Emergency Management Board, credited proactive measures for
   the state's relative calm. "There hasn't been any victim displacement throughout the state yet; only 
   flash flooding has affected certain areas," he stated. He emphasized that N4.2 billion had been spent
    by the Jigawa State Government on emergency response and flood mitigation. "This investment includes 
    building embankments to protect vulnerable communities and dredging rivers to ease water 
  flow," he continued. 

  Speaking to The REALNEWS, Abdullahi Baba-Arah, the Director-General of the Niger State Emergency 
  Management Agency, said that the state's calm following the flooding tragedy in Mokwa Local
   Government was a great relief. We didn't rest on our oars, though. By consistently alerting 
   locals in flood-prone areas to take preventative measures, we have taken the necessary action. 
   Additionally, when there is a warning that heavy rainfall is imminent, which could cause flooding, 
   we have advised residents of riverine areas to 
  
  relocate to higher ground. </p>
